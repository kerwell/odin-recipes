        <h2>The Pizamber Pizza was made by the incredible chef named "Amber Pizarro"</h2>

        <p>Amber Pizarro, world renowned chef, made the pizza by <strong>mistake!</strong> In fact, part of the creation of this dish is credited by her cat, Link!
        one night while creating it, Link jumped into the cupboard and knocked the Jimmy Neutron Bean into the dish!</p>

        <h3>Finally, the steps needed!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bloom the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until
                a shaggy dough begins to form
            </li>
            <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes (get your cat). The dough should be soft,
                smooth, and bouncy. 
            </li>
            <li>Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least
                an hour, or up to 24 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and 
                shape into rounds.
            </li>
            <li>Light flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other 
                ingredients
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven as high as you oven will allow, between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C). Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the 
                surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the oven.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food 
                processor, and puree until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.</li>
            <li>Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during 
                baking.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.</li>
            <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add any garnish of your preference.</li>
