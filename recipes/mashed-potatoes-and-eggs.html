        <h3>Finally, the steps needed!</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to <strong>350° F.</strong> Heat a large oven-safe skillet over <strong>medium</strong> heat. Add water and 
                butter and prepare mashed potatoes as directed on package.
            </li>
            <li>Once mashed potatoes are ready, cover with <strong>2/3</strong> of the shredded cheese. Next, 
                make <strong>4-6</strong> wells in the mashed potatoes for the eggs. Crack eggs into the wells and sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
                Cover with remaining cheese (optional).
            </li>
            <li>Place entire skillet in oven and bake until whites of eggs are just set but yolks are still <strong>slightly</strong> runny, 
                about <strong>12 to 15 minutes</strong>. Top with bacon and sprinkle with green onions. <em>Serve!</em>
