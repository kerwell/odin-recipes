my first project making use of html knowledge.

9/10/22
As I have stated, this is my first project. I know I will be making use of html boilerplates, elements like anchors and images and their associated attributes.
This is really exciting and I can't wait to tackle this. This is the first step to the rest of my life. It's a really big deal!
I will reflect at the end of this about any kind of struggles or how smooth it goes. Well, I'll see ya there!

three or so hours later, I finished. By the end, I felt very comfortable with what I've learned with HTML thus far. I also got familiar with the terminal, git, and vs code's terminal. I didn't save any images, I only used absolute images, but I understand using relative sources since I had to do it with pages anyway. NGL I got a little lazy and made a meme recipe page. It was fun though. I asked some help from the discord on some things and they got answered.
