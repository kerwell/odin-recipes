my first project making use of html knowledge.

9/10/22
As I have stated, this is my first project. I know I will be making use of html boilerplates, elements like anchors and images and their associated attributes.
This is really exciting and I can't wait to tackle this. This is the first step to the rest of my life. It's a really big deal!
I will reflect at the end of this about any kind of struggles or how smooth it goes. Well, I'll see ya there!
